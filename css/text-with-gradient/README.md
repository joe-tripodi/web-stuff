# Text with Gradient
Achieved using:
```css
    background: linear-gradient(to right, #EFED87, #D0E0E0);
    background-clip: text;
    color: transparent;
```
We set the background on the text to have a linear gradient. Then, we clip the background to only be within the text using the `background-clip: text;` property. This clips the background to only be the text. Next we set the text color to be transparent using `color: transparent` this means that the text will become transparent, revealing the background color.
