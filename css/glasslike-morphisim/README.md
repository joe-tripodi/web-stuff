# Glassmorphism
Making the element look like class. The two important css settings are:
```css
background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.01);
backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
```

The `background-color` sets the background to be almost transparent. The `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)` blurs the background slightly, making it appear like glass.

It is important to have a background that is different to the div itself otherwise it won't appear like glass.
